# Luminara (skeleton)

Turn words into living sacred geometry. This repo holds the long-term structure. For now this is just a minimal skeleton with a subfolder npm project.

## Structure

- `apps/web/` — Web client (TypeScript). Currently just `npm init -y` result plus placeholders.
- `packages/` — Future shared libraries (e.g., text→params, shader utils).
- `tools/` — Scripts, CI helpers, build tooling.

## Local setup

```bash
cd apps/web
npm init -y  # already run by agent; included here for reference
```

## Next steps (high level)

See `TODO.md` for the implementation plan.
